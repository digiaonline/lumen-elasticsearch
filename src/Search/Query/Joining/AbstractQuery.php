/**
 * Performing full SQL-style joins in a distributed system like Elasticsearch is prohibitively expensive.
 * Instead, Elasticsearch offers two forms of join which are designed to scale horizontally.
 *
 * - "nested" query
 * Documents may contains fields of type nested. These fields are used to index arrays of objects, where each object can
 * be queried (with the nested query) as an independent document.
 *
 * - "has_child" and "has_parent" queries
 * A parent-child relationship can exist between two document types within a single index. The has_child query returns
 * parent documents whose child documents match the specified query, while the has_parent query returns child documents
 * whose parent document matches the specified query.
 *
 * @see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/joining-queries.html
